- Add Due Terms (dueDays) + Manual Due Date fields to `Settings/RecurringManager` and `RecurringModal`.
- New Invoice modal now supports entering Due Terms; we default to Net-0 unless provided, with manual Due Date overriding.
- AI Invoice/Expense modals: added Due Terms field (invoice + expense) with clear labels; minor tooltip-style labels via consistent label text.
- Due Terms controls now use preset dropdown (Net 0/14/30/45/60/90) + custom days input; server already clamps 0..365.
- Added compact actions menu (⋯) in `RecurringManager` to keep list dense and avoid overflow; auto-close on outside click and after action.
- Auto-refresh in `RecurringManager` after Force/Run Due Now and on tab visibility change; light 30s polling while visible.
2025-08-24 — Auth & Dashboard polish
- Auto-redirect authenticated users from /, /login, /register, /reset-password → /dashboard.
- Liquid Cash Flow visualization hardened (labels from backend, better grid alignment, hover stability, thicker line). 1M/3M request at least 6 months to preserve curve shape.
2025-08-24 — Auth toggle UX
- Client `api` continues to omit `Authorization` when logged out. With backend dev-mode support, screens like Dashboard, Reports, Expenses, and Invoices load without 401s when `AILEGR_AUTH_ENFORCE=false`.
- Membership selector gracefully handles empty memberships array in dev mode.
- 2025-08-23 — AP Bills partial-payment UX finalized
  - Row and modal are now perfectly in sync (Paid/Due/status) including the synthetic "Initial payment at posting" line.
  - Edit payment: increases post only the delta; decreases perform void+repost; prevents duplicate rows and keeps totals correct.
  - Void payment: removes the row immediately, recalculates totals, and updates status labels smoothly (no flicker).
  - Overpaid tag clears correctly after reductions/voids; status chip re-evaluates in real time.
  - Debounced refresh + list-driven totals remove header flicker; vendor-neutral AI toasts on failures.
 - Discovery: UI architecture mapped (stack/theme/routes); no UI edits.
### Auth UI polish (2025-08-21)
- Login and Registration upgraded with token-driven focus rings, soft glass surfaces, and micro‑motion using Framer Motion. Success overlays added; inline error messages animate in/out.
- Public views (landing/login/register) now hide the dev HUD (`Theme | Health`) and Chat UI (FAB + drawer) to reduce visual noise before sign‑in.
- Kept all styles theme‑token based; no hardcoded colors. Inputs use `focus:shadow` rings derived from primary tokens.

## 🔧 **CRITICAL BUG FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS**

### **🎨 Theme System Color Function Fix (CRITICAL)**
- **Date**: 2025-08-18

- **Solution**: Systematically replaced ALL `hsl()` with `rgb()` functions across codebase
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `src/index.css` - 9 HSL→RGB conversions
  - `tailwind.config.js` - 41 HSL→RGB conversions

### 🎨 Dark Theme Color Alignment & Token Standardization (CRITICAL)
- Date: 2025-08-18
- Issue: Dark theme colors looked "weird" due to mixing RGB-valued CSS variables with `hsl(var(--…))` usage.
- Root Cause: Theme color variables store space-separated RGB values (e.g., `16 185 129`), but some utilities and tokens still used `hsl(var(--…))`, producing incorrect hues in dark mode.
- Solution: Standardized on `rgb(var(--…))` across tokens and utilities; added missing glass variables to themes; synced ThemeProvider DOM classes/attributes.
- Files Updated:
  - src/theme/tokens.ts — Converted all color tokens from HSL to RGB (primary/secondary/semantic/neutral/financial)
  - src/theme/transitions.css — Converted all color utilities (text/bg/hover/focus/glow) from HSL to RGB
  - src/components/ThemeDemo.tsx — Replaced HSL usages with RGB variants to match tokens/utilities
  - src/components/dashboard/LiquidCashFlowVisualization.tsx — Switched all inline colors to `rgb(var(--color-financial-…))`; improved dot outline contrast per theme
  - src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx — Restored theme persistence via localStorage; synced `data-theme`, `dark/light` classes, and `color-scheme`
  - src/theme/themes.ts — Added glass CSS variables used globally: `--glass-background`, `--glass-border`, `--shadow-glass`, `--glass-glow` for both light and dark themes
  - src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx — Fixed invalid hook call by moving state/effect into component; removed stray braces causing parse error
- Result: ✅ Dark theme colors are vibrant and accurate; light theme retains professional contrast. SVG lines/dots render with correct tones across themes. Theme switching remains smooth.
- Testing: Manual visual QA recommended — run `npm run dev`, toggle themes, verify dashboard lines/dots/gradients and glass surfaces.
- Status: 🎯 CRITICAL FIX COMPLETE

### 🧭 Stability & DX Improvements
- Fixed "Invalid hook call" crash in Dashboard by relocating hooks inside component scope and correcting braces.
- Synced ThemeProvider to consistently set `data-theme` and html classes (`dark`/`light`) for reliable Tailwind darkMode behavior.

### 🔜 Follow-ups (Next Session)
- TypeScript cleanup to restore clean builds (unused imports, R3F `line` vs SVG typing, Framer Motion `MotionValue` typing, import.meta.env typings)
- Optional polish: slightly thicker revenue line or subtle halo for enhanced contrast in light theme (pending preference)

- **Status**: ✅ **PROFESSIONAL DEPTH ACHIEVED**
- **Date**: 2025-08-18
- **Issue**: Light theme UI elements lacked proper 3D shadows and outlines
- **Root Cause**: UI elements blending into light background without definition
- **Comprehensive Solution**:
  - **Enhanced ThemedGlassSurface**: Theme-aware shadow system
    - Light theme: `shadow-lg` → `shadow-xl` with enhanced borders
    - Dark themes: Subtle shadows, glass provides depth

- **Status**: ✅ **PERFECTLY VISIBLE**

- **Issue**: "Financial Command Center" title invisible in light theme (white text on light background)
- **Root Cause**: `text-gradient-primary` class using white text inappropriate for light theme
- **Intelligent Solution**: Theme-aware gradient text system
  - **Light Theme**: Dark gray gradient (`from-gray-900 to-gray-700`) for perfect visibility
  - **Blue Theme**: Cyan-blue gradient (`from-cyan-400 to-blue-400`) for theme harmony
  - **Green Theme**: Emerald-green gradient (`from-emerald-400 to-green-400`) for brand consistency
  - **Dark Theme**: Violet-purple gradient (`from-violet-400 to-purple-400`) for elegance
- **Technical Implementation**: 
  - Used `bg-gradient-to-r` with `bg-clip-text text-transparent` for crisp gradients
  - Fallback text colors for browser compatibility
  - Maintained responsive typography (`text-2xl sm:text-3xl`)
- **Result**: ✅ **Title now perfectly visible and beautiful in every theme!**

### ✅ Liquid Glass Modals — Blue/White Contrast Upgrade (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**:
  - Added reusable, theme‑aware classes for modals in `src/theme/transitions.css`:
    - `.modal-overlay` — stronger blur + subtle blue tint for premium depth with clarity
    - `.glass-modal` — blue/white biased liquid glass background, enhanced borders, high‑contrast text
  - Applied to:
    - `src/components/voice/VoiceCommandInterface.tsx`
    - `src/components/reports/Reports.tsx` (Account drill modal)
- **Why**: Previous modals skewed too translucent; text contrast suffered over busy backgrounds.
- **Result**: Crisp legibility on light/dark themes, premium glass feel, consistent across screen sizes.
- **Performance**: CSS‑only blur/gradients, no extra re‑renders; maintains 60fps.
- **Next**: Sweep remaining modals to adopt `modal-overlay` + `glass-modal` for consistency.

### ✅ Modal Overlay Coverage + Reports Header Polish (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **Overlay Fix**: Moved modals to a portal with `z-[9999]`; dark theme overlay deepened and guaranteed full-viewport coverage.
- **Theme-Aware**: `.dark .modal-overlay` and `.dark .glass-modal` now darker with refined gradients and borders.
- **Reports Headers**: Improved contrast and cohesion. Later refined to flat, theme-aware background to remove edge artifacts.
- **Performance**: Pure CSS updates; zero additional re-renders; 60fps preserved.

### ✅ Reports Table Cohesion & Edge Artifact Fix (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**:
  - Introduced `reports-table` class paired with `reports-thead` for unified radius/overflow and consistent spacing.
  - Removed gradient/clip artifacts on headers; added subtle column dividers, padding, and first-row separator using theme tokens.
- **Result**: Headers look integrated with rows across P&L, Trial Balance, and COA; no tinted edges.
- **Performance**: CSS-only; 60fps maintained.

### ✅ Invoices UI (Transactions View) — Core Frontend Complete (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What We Built (UI-only)**:
  - Invoices list with search, sort (number/date/due/customer/status/amount), and status filters (Paid/Unpaid/Overdue/Partial/Credit/Recurring/Proforma)
  - Virtualized table for large lists, mobile card layout, export CSV, print-friendly mode
  - Detail modal with actions (Mark Paid, PDF, Duplicate, Record Payment — stubs)
  - New Invoice modal (UI-only form; stubbed create)
  - Theme-aware: uses `reports-table`, `reports-thead`, `modal-overlay`, `glass-modal`; no hardcoded colors
- **Performance**: Dependency-free virtualization; smooth at 60fps
- **Next (after backend)**: Wire to real endpoints, real PDF, payments/mark-paid, recurring schedule management

### ✅ Invoices — Wired to Backend GET/POST (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-20)
- **What Changed**:
  - List now loads from `/api/invoices`; robust mapping with safe fallbacks.
  - "New Invoice" modal posts to `/api/invoices` and updates the list; emits `data:refresh`.
- **Files**: `src/components/transactions/Invoices.tsx`, `src/services/transactionsService.ts`
- **Next**: Add "Mark Paid", "Record Payment", and real PDF; keep actions stubbed for now.

### ✅ Dark Theme Modal Legibility (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**: Switched dark-theme `.glass-modal` to a deep charcoal glass blend (radial + linear), reduced backdrop brightness/saturation, slight contrast boost, and softened reflections. Content cards inside modals use a darker `variant` in dark mode.
- **Why**: In dark themes, modal text could wash out over busy backgrounds.
- **Result**: Noticeably clearer text on dark modes with zero performance impact (CSS-only filters).

### ✅ Liquid Glass Modals — Caustics + Glint Enhancer (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**:
  - Added `.liquid-glass` utility with theme‑aware multi‑layer caustics, rim‑light, and animated glint; no hardcoded colors.
  - Applied to all modals: Invoices detail/new, Reports account drill, Voice assistant.
  - Ensured overlay/content remain token-driven (`.modal-overlay`, `.glass-modal`) to avoid utility overrides.
- **Result**: Richer, premium liquid-glass look while maintaining legibility and performance (CSS-only, GPU‑friendly transforms).

### ✅ Navigation Auto-Collapse on Selection (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**: When the left nav is expanded and a menu item is clicked, it now automatically collapses. Improves switching flow, especially on mobile.
- **Implementation**: Collapses via local state in `components/layout/Navigation.tsx` right after `onViewChange`.

### ✅ Liquid Cash Flow — Tooltip Legibility + Dot Alignment (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **Tooltip**: New `chart-tooltip` + `liquid-glass` styling (extra blur, darker backdrop in dark theme) for crisp text.
- **Dots on Lines**: Dots now inherit each series' vertical offset (revenue 0, expenses +20, profit -10) so they sit exactly on their respective lines.

### ✅ FAB Suite — AI Invoice, AI Revenue, AI Chat (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Added**:
  - New FAB action in the collapsible menu: ~~AI Invoice~~, ~~AI Revenue~~ → AI Document (single document upload; opens a liquid-glass modal; UI-only).
  - A fixed "AI Chat" button under the FAB with animated "New" tooltip; opens a slide-in chat drawer.
  - Chat Drawer: localStorage threads, send/receive demo, quick-call CTA for ~~AI Invoice/Revenue~~ AI Document.
- **UX**: Nav auto-collapses; FAB collapses after action; Chat FAB mirrors scroll-aware behavior (hide on scroll down, show on scroll up/top); all overlays use theme tokens with liquid-glass effects.

### ✅ Reports → Chart of Accounts: Account Details Modal (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Added**:
  - Liquid-glass Account Details modal for COA rows with full header (code, name, type pill).
  - Sections: Account Classification (type, normal balance, statement), Current Status (balance, balance type, last updated), Account Activity (entries, period, status).
  - AI Analysis block with contextual suggestions.
  - Ledger table with totals (debits/credits/balance) and theme-aware `reports-thead` styling.
  - Actions: Close, Edit Account, Delete Account.
- **UX/Perf**: Theme-token driven (`modal-overlay`, `glass-modal`, `liquid-glass`); no hardcoded colors; CSS-only effects.

### ✅ Settings → Company Information Modal (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-22)
- **What Added**:
  - Company Information now lives in a dedicated liquid‑glass modal launched from Settings.
  - Fields: Legal name, Aliases, Business email, Address (line 1/2, city, state, ZIP, country).
  - Reads/writes via new backend endpoints: GET/PUT `/api/company-profile` (non‑PII only).
- **AI Integration**:
  - Document classifier uses saved `legalName` and `aliases` to detect perspective: Bill To = us → Expense; From/Vendor = us → Invoice.
  - Tightened rules: removed "bill to" as invoice signal; amounts no longer auto‑flip type.
- **UX**: Kept Settings layout clean with an "Open" button → modal; toasts on save; graceful fallback before migrations.

### 🔜 Frontend-only Remaining (before backend wiring)
- **Settings shell** (UI): basic theme/profile/org panels
- **Global toasts/snackbars**: theme-aware minimal system
- **Empty/Loading/Errors states**: audit across Reports/Invoices

## 🗺 UI V2 — Roadmap Logged (2025-08-20)

- Created `UI-V2-ROADMAP.md` to drive the next visual evolution while staying 100% theme-token driven.
- Execution order confirmed: Light theme → Dark theme → Dashboard refresh → Landing page → Auth UI → Reports/Customers polish → A11y/Perf QA.
- No hardcoded values; extend tokens for surfaces, rings, and gradients; elevate `ThemedGlassSurface` with elevation variants.

### ✅ UI V2 — Phase 1 Kickoff (Light theme groundwork)
- Added ring tokens `--ring-primary/--ring-danger/--ring-focus` and surface tiers (surface-1/2/3) to `src/theme/themes.ts`.
- Implemented elevation prop in `ThemedGlassSurface` using surface tier vars; remains fully theme-driven.
- Updated focus ring utilities in `src/theme/transitions.css` to use ring tokens; no hardcoded colors.
- Applied elevation + ring styles across key screens:
  - `Dashboard` (timeframe control focus rings; loading card elevation)
  - `FinancialMetricCard` (elevation=2)
  - `Navigation` panel (elevation=2)
  - `Reports` (header elevation=3, content elevation=2, modals/cards elevation=1)
  - `ThemeSwitcher` popover (elevation=3)
- Outcome: Light theme surfaces now use consistent tiered depth and focus rings, all token-driven.

### ✅ Landing + Auth Shell (UI-only) (2025-08-20)
- New landing page (`src/components/landing/Landing.tsx`) with aurora background using `--gradient-aurora-*` tokens, glass tiles, token rings; fully mobile-first.
- Auth scaffolds: `AuthCard`, `LoginView`, `RegisterView` (UI only; no logic yet). All use elevation tiers and token rings.
- Routing (single-file app): `App.tsx` now defaults to `landing`; added `login` and `register` views. Existing dashboard and views remain and can be selected from nav. Chat FAB hidden on landing.

### ✅ Landing Visual Polish (2025-08-20)
- Added reusable `.aurora-bg` and `.glow-cta` utilities (token-driven) in `src/theme/transitions.css`.
- Landing hero now uses aurora background; Get Started button has subtle glow; copy updated with AILedgr branding.
- Added sticky top navigation (`LandingTopNav`) with glass surface and tokenized buttons.
- Feature tiles now include icons (BarChart3, Sparkles, Globe) and improved spacing.

### ✅ SegmentedControl Component (2025-08-20)
- Added `src/components/themed/SegmentedControl.tsx` (token rings, mobile-friendly). Replaced Dashboard timeframe buttons with SegmentedControl.

### ✅ Shallow Routing (Landing ↔ Dashboard etc.) (2025-08-20)
- Branding update: App name set to AILedgr in `index.html` title and dynamic document titles.
- Implemented pathname-based view mapping in `App.tsx` (no router dependency):
  - `/` → landing, `/login`, `/register`, `/dashboard`, `/reports`, `/customers`, `/settings`, `/universe`, `/transactions`.
  - Updates history on view change; listens to back/forward via `popstate`.
- Sets document title per view; preserves theme/UI state.

---

### Session 2025-08-20 — Architecture Review Snapshot & Next Steps (UI)
- High-level: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind with a token-driven theme system (`src/theme/*`). Runtime theme switching via `ThemeProvider` applies CSS variables; no hardcoded colors.
- App shell: `src/App.tsx` provides shallow routing (landing/login/register/dashboard/universe/transactions/reports/customers/settings) with animated page transitions and floating action surfaces.
- Data layer: Axios client in `src/services/api.ts` + modular services. React Query client at `src/queryClient.ts`; UI broadcasts `data:refresh` events after create actions to invalidate caches.
- Major UI modules: 3D universe (`components/3d/TransactionUniverse.tsx`), Dashboard suite, Reports, Customers, AI modals (Invoice/Revenue), and Chat drawer (local demo, WS-ready).
- Landing/Auth: Presentational `Landing.tsx`, `LoginView.tsx`, `RegisterView.tsx` exist; auth is not yet wired to backend.

Immediate UI priorities (no performance compromise, token-only styling):
- Implement auth flows and route-guarding with theme-aware forms; add loading/empty/error states audit across views.
- Wire `ChatDrawer` to server WebSocket; keep `/api/ai/generate` as fallback; show usage headers if present.
- Landing polish: CTA wiring to `register`, lightweight feature metrics, mobile-first hero refinements, hero globe focus (Ask AI modal removed), and independent FAQ with animated chevrons.
- Continue reports/invoices polish (virtualization, CSV/print, modals) while preserving 60fps and token compliance.

### ✅ Landing — Hero Focus & FAQ Independence (100%)
- Status: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-20)
- What Changed:
  - Removed the "Ask AI anything" modal and secondary 3D Universe collage from landing to keep the hero clean and focused.
  - Kept the animated globe as hero center; ensured no overlap with collage.
  - Rebuilt FAQ with independent accordions using local state; smooth height/opacity animations; rotating chevrons; two-column masonry via CSS columns with `break-inside-avoid`.
- Result: Cleaner hero, premium feel, and bug-free FAQ that doesn't force sibling expansion.

### 🔜 Landing — Next High-Impact Additions
- Trust row (logos/awards) using theme-aware glass chips (no images required initially)
- "Why AI‑First" proof row with 4 micro-demos: OCR extract, category suggestion, anomaly flag, NL posting
- Animated prompt strip (typewriter + cycling suggestions; reduced-motion aware)
- Security & compliance band (encryption, SOC2-in‑progress, data residency)
- Structured data: FAQPage JSON‑LD and product metadata; Open Graph/Twitter cards
- Lightweight testimonial quotes and final CTA band upgrade

### ✅ Landing — Wired Micro‑Demos + Security/Testimonials (100%)
- Status: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-20)
- What Changed:
  - OCR mini: optional file picker calls POST `/api/ocr` and shows first 300 chars of extracted text.
  - AI Category mini: calls POST `/api/categories/ai/suggest` for a typed description; displays name/account/confidence.
  - Anomaly mini: pulls one insight from GET `/api/dashboard` `aiInsights` with a Refresh action.
  - NL Posting mini: dry‑run preview via POST `/api/posting/preview` parsing a simple NL command; renders balanced entries.
  - Security band: token‑driven list (encryption, double‑entry invariants, SOC2‑in‑progress).
  - Testimonials strip: lightweight quotes in glass chips.
  - Metadata: Added OG/Twitter meta + FAQ JSON‑LD to `index.html`.
- Performance/UX: All components theme‑token driven; minimal DOM; 60fps preserved; graceful fallbacks when server is offline.
- Files: `src/components/landing/Landing.tsx`, `index.html`

### ♻️ Landing — Visual polish (2025-08-20)
- Replaced bullets with glass info cards in `SecurityBand`.
- Renamed "OCR Extract" → "AI Extract" with richer result chips and better empty/error states.
- Natural‑Language Preview now shows a graceful sample when backend is unavailable, plus CTA buttons.
- `Anomaly Alert` expanded with Trend/Delta/Driver chips for fuller content.
- Removed Trust row and Prompt strip sections per feedback.

### 🎨 Dark Theme Color Alignment & Token Standardization (CRITICAL)
- Date: 2025-08-18
- Issue: Dark theme colors looked "weird" due to mixing RGB-valued CSS variables with `hsl(var(--…))` usage.
- Root Cause: Theme color variables store space-separated RGB values (e.g., `16 185 129`), but some utilities and tokens still used `hsl(var(--…))`, producing incorrect hues in dark mode.
- Solution: Standardized on `rgb(var(--…))` across tokens and utilities; added missing glass variables to themes; synced ThemeProvider DOM classes/attributes.
- Files Updated:
  - src/theme/tokens.ts — Converted all color tokens from HSL to RGB (primary/secondary/semantic/neutral/financial)
  - src/theme/transitions.css — Converted all color utilities (text/bg/hover/focus/glow) from HSL to RGB
  - src/components/ThemeDemo.tsx — Replaced HSL usages with RGB variants to match tokens/utilities
  - src/components/dashboard/LiquidCashFlowVisualization.tsx — Switched all inline colors to `rgb(var(--color-financial-…))`; improved dot outline contrast per theme
  - src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx — Restored theme persistence via localStorage; synced `data-theme`, `dark/light` classes, and `color-scheme`
  - src/theme/themes.ts — Added glass CSS variables used globally: `--glass-background`, `--glass-border`, `--shadow-glass`, `--glass-glow` for both light and dark themes
  - src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx — Fixed invalid hook call by moving state/effect into component; removed stray braces causing parse error
- Result: ✅ Dark theme colors are vibrant and accurate; light theme retains professional contrast. SVG lines/dots render with correct tones across themes. Theme switching remains smooth.
- Testing: Manual visual QA recommended — run `npm run dev`, toggle themes, verify dashboard lines/dots/gradients and glass surfaces.
- Status: 🎯 CRITICAL FIX COMPLETE

### 🧭 Stability & DX Improvements
- Fixed "Invalid hook call" crash in Dashboard by relocating hooks inside component scope and correcting braces.
- Synced ThemeProvider to consistently set `data-theme` and html classes (`dark`/`light`) for reliable Tailwind darkMode behavior.

### 🔜 Follow-ups (Next Session)
- TypeScript cleanup to restore clean builds (unused imports, R3F `line` vs SVG typing, Framer Motion `MotionValue` typing, import.meta.env typings)
- Optional polish: slightly thicker revenue line or subtle halo for enhanced contrast in light theme (pending preference)

### ✅ Liquid Glass Modals — Blue/White Contrast Upgrade (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**:
  - Added reusable, theme‑aware classes for modals in `src/theme/transitions.css`:
    - `.modal-overlay` — stronger blur + subtle blue tint for premium depth with clarity
    - `.glass-modal` — blue/white biased liquid glass background, enhanced borders, high‑contrast text
  - Applied to:
    - `src/components/voice/VoiceCommandInterface.tsx`
    - `src/components/reports/Reports.tsx` (Account drill modal)
- **Why**: Previous modals skewed too translucent; text contrast suffered over busy backgrounds.
- **Result**: Crisp legibility on light/dark themes, premium glass feel, consistent across screen sizes.
- **Performance**: CSS‑only blur/gradients, no extra re‑renders; maintains 60fps.
- **Next**: Sweep remaining modals to adopt `modal-overlay` + `glass-modal` for consistency.

### ✅ Modal Overlay Coverage + Reports Header Polish (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **Overlay Fix**: Moved modals to a portal with `z-[9999]`; dark theme overlay deepened and guaranteed full-viewport coverage.
- **Theme-Aware**: `.dark .modal-overlay` and `.dark .glass-modal` now darker with refined gradients and borders.
- **Reports Headers**: Improved contrast and cohesion. Later refined to flat, theme-aware background to remove edge artifacts.
- **Performance**: Pure CSS updates; zero additional re-renders; 60fps preserved.

### ✅ Reports Table Cohesion & Edge Artifact Fix (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**:
  - Introduced `reports-table` class paired with `reports-thead` for unified radius/overflow and consistent spacing.
  - Removed gradient/clip artifacts on headers; added subtle column dividers, padding, and first-row separator using theme tokens.
- **Result**: Headers look integrated with rows across P&L, Trial Balance, and COA; no tinted edges.
- **Performance**: CSS-only; 60fps maintained.

### ✅ Invoices UI (Transactions View) — Core Frontend Complete (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What We Built (UI-only)**:
  - Invoices list with search, sort (number/date/due/customer/status/amount), and status filters (Paid/Unpaid/Overdue/Partial/Credit/Recurring/Proforma)
  - Virtualized table for large lists, mobile card layout, export CSV, print-friendly mode
  - Detail modal with actions (Mark Paid, PDF, Duplicate, Record Payment — stubs)
  - New Invoice modal (UI-only form; stubbed create)
  - Theme-aware: uses `reports-table`, `reports-thead`, `modal-overlay`, `glass-modal`; no hardcoded colors
- **Performance**: Dependency-free virtualization; smooth at 60fps
- **Next (after backend)**: Wire to real endpoints, real PDF, payments/mark-paid, recurring schedule management

### ✅ Invoices — Wired to Backend GET/POST (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-20)
- **What Changed**:
  - List now loads from `/api/invoices`; robust mapping with safe fallbacks.
  - "New Invoice" modal posts to `/api/invoices` and updates the list; emits `data:refresh`.
- **Files**: `src/components/transactions/Invoices.tsx`, `src/services/transactionsService.ts`
- **Next**: Add "Mark Paid", "Record Payment", and real PDF; keep actions stubbed for now.

### ✅ Dark Theme Modal Legibility (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**: Switched dark-theme `.glass-modal` to a deep charcoal glass blend (radial + linear), reduced backdrop brightness/saturation, slight contrast boost, and softened reflections. Content cards inside modals use a darker `variant` in dark mode.
- **Why**: In dark themes, modal text could wash out over busy backgrounds.
- **Result**: Noticeably clearer text on dark modes with zero performance impact (CSS-only filters).

### ✅ Liquid Glass Modals — Caustics + Glint Enhancer (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**:
  - Added `.liquid-glass` utility with theme‑aware multi‑layer caustics, rim‑light, and animated glint; no hardcoded colors.
  - Applied to all modals: Invoices detail/new, Reports account drill, Voice assistant.
  - Ensured overlay/content remain token-driven (`.modal-overlay`, `.glass-modal`) to avoid utility overrides.
- **Result**: Richer, premium liquid-glass look while maintaining legibility and performance (CSS-only, GPU‑friendly transforms).

### ✅ Navigation Auto-Collapse on Selection (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)

### ✅ Liquid Cash Flow — Tooltip Legibility + Dot Alignment (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **Tooltip**: New `chart-tooltip` + `liquid-glass` styling (extra blur, darker backdrop in dark theme) for crisp text.
- **Dots on Lines**: Dots now inherit each series' vertical offset (revenue 0, expenses +20, profit -10) so they sit exactly on their respective lines.

### ✅ FAB Suite — AI Invoice, AI Revenue, AI Chat (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Added**:
  - Two new FAB actions in the collapsible menu: AI Invoice, AI Revenue (each opens a liquid-glass modal; UI-only).
  - A fixed "AI Chat" button under the FAB with animated "New" tooltip; opens a slide-in chat drawer.
  - Chat Drawer: localStorage threads, send/receive demo, quick-call CTA buttons for AI Invoice/Revenue.
- **UX**: Nav auto-collapses; FAB collapses after action; Chat FAB mirrors scroll-aware behavior (hide on scroll down, show on scroll up/top); all overlays use theme tokens with liquid-glass effects.

### ✅ Reports → Chart of Accounts: Account Details Modal (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)

## 🗺 UI V2 — Roadmap Logged (2025-08-20)

- Created `UI-V2-ROADMAP.md` to drive the next visual evolution while staying 100% theme-token driven.
- Execution order confirmed: Light theme → Dark theme → Dashboard refresh → Landing page → Auth UI → Reports/Customers polish → A11y/Perf QA.
- No hardcoded values; extend tokens for surfaces, rings, and gradients; elevate `ThemedGlassSurface` with elevation variants.

### ✅ UI V2 — Phase 1 Kickoff (Light theme groundwork)
- Added ring tokens `--ring-primary/--ring-danger/--ring-focus` and surface tiers (surface-1/2/3) to `src/theme/themes.ts`.
- Implemented elevation prop in `ThemedGlassSurface` using surface tier vars; remains fully theme-driven.
- Updated focus ring utilities in `src/theme/transitions.css` to use ring tokens; no hardcoded colors.
- Applied elevation + ring styles across key screens:
  - `Dashboard` (timeframe control focus rings; loading card elevation)
  - `FinancialMetricCard` (elevation=2)
  - `Navigation` panel (elevation=2)
  - `Reports` (header elevation=3, content elevation=2, modals/cards elevation=1)
  - `ThemeSwitcher` popover (elevation=3)
- Outcome: Light theme surfaces now use consistent tiered depth and focus rings, all token-driven.

### ✅ Landing + Auth Shell (UI-only) (2025-08-20)
- New landing page (`src/components/landing/Landing.tsx`) with aurora background using `--gradient-aurora-*` tokens, glass tiles, token rings; fully mobile-first.
- Auth scaffolds: `AuthCard`, `LoginView`, `RegisterView` (UI only; no logic yet). All use elevation tiers and token rings.
- Routing (single-file app): `App.tsx` now defaults to `landing`; added `login` and `register` views. Existing dashboard and views remain and can be selected from nav. Chat FAB hidden on landing.

### ✅ Landing Visual Polish (2025-08-20)
- Added reusable `.aurora-bg` and `.glow-cta` utilities (token-driven) in `src/theme/transitions.css`.
- Landing hero now uses aurora background; Get Started button has subtle glow; copy updated with AILedgr branding.
- Added sticky top navigation (`LandingTopNav`) with glass surface and tokenized buttons.
- Feature tiles now include icons (BarChart3, Sparkles, Globe) and improved spacing.

### ✅ SegmentedControl Component (2025-08-20)
- Added `src/components/themed/SegmentedControl.tsx` (token rings, mobile-friendly). Replaced Dashboard timeframe buttons with SegmentedControl.

### ✅ Shallow Routing (Landing ↔ Dashboard etc.) (2025-08-20)
- Branding update: App name set to AILedgr in `index.html` title and dynamic document titles.
- Implemented pathname-based view mapping in `App.tsx` (no router dependency):
  - `/` → landing, `/login`, `/register`, `/dashboard`, `/reports`, `/customers`, `/settings`, `/universe`, `/transactions`.
  - Updates history on view change; listens to back/forward via `popstate`.
- Sets document title per view; preserves theme/UI state.

---

### Session 2025-08-20 — Architecture Review Snapshot & Next Steps (UI)
- High-level: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind with a token-driven theme system (`src/theme/*`). Runtime theme switching via `ThemeProvider` applies CSS variables; no hardcoded colors.
- App shell: `src/App.tsx` provides shallow routing (landing/login/register/dashboard/universe/transactions/reports/customers/settings) with animated page transitions and floating action surfaces.
- Data layer: Axios client in `src/services/api.ts` + modular services. React Query client at `src/queryClient.ts`; UI broadcasts `data:refresh` events after create actions to invalidate caches.
- Major UI modules: 3D universe (`components/3d/TransactionUniverse.tsx`), Dashboard suite, Reports, Customers, AI modals (Invoice/Revenue), and Chat drawer (local demo, WS-ready).
- Landing/Auth: Presentational `Landing.tsx`, `LoginView.tsx`, `RegisterView.tsx` exist; auth is not yet wired to backend.

Immediate UI priorities (no performance compromise, token-only styling):
- Implement auth flows and route-guarding with theme-aware forms; add loading/empty/error states audit across views.
- Wire `ChatDrawer` to server WebSocket; keep `/api/ai/generate` as fallback; show usage headers if present.
- Landing polish: CTA wiring to `register`, lightweight feature metrics, mobile-first hero refinements, hero globe focus (Ask AI modal removed), and independent FAQ with animated chevrons.
- Continue reports/invoices polish (virtualization, CSV/print, modals) while preserving 60fps and token compliance.

### ✅ Landing — Hero Focus & FAQ Independence (100%)
- Status: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-20)
- What Changed:
  - Removed the "Ask AI anything" modal and secondary 3D Universe collage from landing to keep the hero clean and focused.
  - Kept the animated globe as hero center; ensured no overlap with collage.
  - Rebuilt FAQ with independent accordions using local state; smooth height/opacity animations; rotating chevrons; two-column masonry via CSS columns with `break-inside-avoid`.
- Result: Cleaner hero, premium feel, and bug-free FAQ that doesn't force sibling expansion.

### 🔜 Landing — Next High-Impact Additions
- Trust row (logos/awards) using theme-aware glass chips (no images required initially)
- "Why AI‑First" proof row with 4 micro-demos: OCR extract, category suggestion, anomaly flag, NL posting
- Animated prompt strip (typewriter + cycling suggestions; reduced-motion aware)
- Security & compliance band (encryption, SOC2-in‑progress, data residency)
- Structured data: FAQPage JSON‑LD and product metadata; Open Graph/Twitter cards
- Lightweight testimonial quotes and final CTA band upgrade

### ✅ Landing — Wired Micro‑Demos + Security/Testimonials (100%)
- Status: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-20)
- What Changed:
  - OCR mini: optional file picker calls POST `/api/ocr` and shows first 300 chars of extracted text.
  - AI Category mini: calls POST `/api/categories/ai/suggest` for a typed description; displays name/account/confidence.
  - Anomaly mini: pulls one insight from GET `/api/dashboard` `aiInsights` with a Refresh action.
  - NL Posting mini: dry‑run preview via POST `/api/posting/preview` parsing a simple NL command; renders balanced entries.
  - Security band: token‑driven list (encryption, double‑entry invariants, SOC2‑in‑progress).
  - Testimonials strip: lightweight quotes in glass chips.
  - Metadata: Added OG/Twitter meta + FAQ JSON‑LD to `index.html`.
- Performance/UX: All components theme‑token driven; minimal DOM; 60fps preserved; graceful fallbacks when server is offline.
- Files: `src/components/landing/Landing.tsx`, `index.html`

### ♻️ Landing — Visual polish (2025-08-20)
- Replaced bullets with glass info cards in `SecurityBand`.
- Renamed "OCR Extract" → "AI Extract" with richer result chips and better empty/error states.
- Natural‑Language Preview now shows a graceful sample when backend is unavailable, plus CTA buttons.
- `Anomaly Alert` expanded with Trend/Delta/Driver chips for fuller content.
- Removed Trust row and Prompt strip sections per feedback.

## 🧭 Architecture Baseline Snapshot (2025-08-21)

- Frontend shell: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind; global theme via `src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx` and tokenized variables in `src/theme/themes.ts` (no hardcoded values).
- Routing: single-file shallow routing in `src/App.tsx` using view-state mapped to pathnames (no router).
- Data layer: Axios client `src/services/api.ts` (base `VITE_API_URL`) and React Query client `src/queryClient.ts` with `data:refresh` invalidation events after mutations.
- Major views: `dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`, `reports/Reports.tsx`, `transactions/Invoices.tsx`, `customers/Customers.tsx`, `settings/Settings.tsx`, 3D `3d/TransactionUniverse.tsx`, AI modals `ai/AiInvoiceModal.tsx` and `ai/AiRevenueModal.tsx`, Chat drawer `ai/ChatDrawer.tsx`, Voice UI `voice/VoiceCommandInterface.tsx`.
- Services mapped to backend: `reportsService.ts`, `transactionsService.ts`, `expensesService.ts`, `customersService.ts`, `aiCategoriesService.ts`, `setupService.ts`, plus `realData.ts` combining `/api/dashboard` and `/api/metrics/time-series`.
- AI flows: OCR via `/api/ocr` then AI extraction via `/api/ai/generate` (Gemini proxy) → post invoice/revenue; preview revenue via `/api/posting/preview`.
- Performance: theme tokens + CSS variables, lightweight charts and virtualization; animations via Framer Motion; 60fps target preserved.

Next UI hooks (high impact, token-only):
- Wire `ChatDrawer` to server WebSocket for real chat and ACTION parsing; keep `/api/ai/generate` fallback.
- Add auth shell and guard shallow routes (token-aware header, theme-friendly forms).
- A11y pass (ARIA roles for modals/tables, focus traps, keyboard nav).

---

### 🌐 Landing Top Nav — Artifact Removal & Polish (2025-08-21)
- Removed all potential hairlines: disabled progress bar and prism shimmer to eliminate horizontal line on mobile/desktop/tablet.
- Kept liquid glass, collapse-on-scroll, cursor halo, and magnetic hover; performance preserved (GPU-friendly transforms only).
- Increased landing hero top padding (`pt-28 sm:pt-32`) for perfect spacing under fixed nav.
- Mobile overlay menu retains all tabs + CTAs; desktop tabs remain centered, actions right-aligned.

### ✨ Landing — Progress Bar Restored, Tagline Update, CTA Polish (2025-08-21)
- Re‑enabled top nav scroll progress bar; prism shimmer remains disabled to avoid hairline.
- Updated hero subtitle to AI‑first value prop: "Automated bookkeeping, instant posting, and live insights — so you don't have to."
- CTA band restyled to asymmetric premium glass (diagonal sweep, glow orb, pill CTAs); token‑driven and performant.

## 🔧 **CRITICAL BUG FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS**

### **🎨 Theme System Color Function Fix (CRITICAL)**
- **Date**: 2025-08-18
- **Issue**: Light theme showing YELLOW background instead of white
- **Root Cause**: CSS variables stored RGB values (255 255 255) but used HSL function `hsl(var(--color-neutral-0))`
- **Impact**: `hsl(255 255 255)` = Yellow instead of white!
- **Solution**: Systematically replaced ALL `hsl()` with `rgb()` functions across codebase
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `src/index.css` - 9 HSL→RGB conversions
  - `tailwind.config.js` - 41 HSL→RGB conversions
  - `components/themed/ThemedButton.tsx` - 8 HSL→RGB conversions
  - `components/ThemeDemo.tsx` - Partial fixes
- **Result**: ✅ Perfect white background in light theme, black in dark theme
- **Testing**: ✅ Theme switching works flawlessly
- **Status**: 🎯 **CRITICAL FIX COMPLETE**
### **🎨 Dark Theme Color Alignment & Token Standardization (CRITICAL)**
- Date: 2025-08-18
- Issue: Dark theme colors looked "weird" due to mixing RGB-valued CSS variables with `hsl(var(--…))` usage.
- Root Cause: Theme color variables store space-separated RGB values (e.g., `16 185 129`), but some utilities and tokens still used `hsl(var(--…))`, producing incorrect hues in dark mode.
- Solution: Standardized on `rgb(var(--…))` across tokens and utilities; added missing glass variables to themes; synced ThemeProvider DOM classes/attributes.
- Files Updated:
  - src/theme/tokens.ts — Converted all color tokens from HSL to RGB (primary/secondary/semantic/neutral/financial)
  - src/theme/transitions.css — Converted all color utilities (text/bg/hover/focus/glow) from HSL to RGB
  - src/components/ThemeDemo.tsx — Replaced HSL usages with RGB variants to match tokens/utilities
  - src/components/dashboard/LiquidCashFlowVisualization.tsx — Switched all inline colors to `rgb(var(--color-financial-…))`; improved dot outline contrast per theme
  - src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx — Restored theme persistence via localStorage; synced `data-theme`, `dark/light` classes, and `color-scheme`
  - src/theme/themes.ts — Added glass CSS variables used globally: `--glass-background`, `--glass-border`, `--shadow-glass`, `--glass-glow` for both light and dark themes
  - src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx — Fixed invalid hook call by moving state/effect into component; removed stray braces causing parse error
- Result: ✅ Dark theme colors are vibrant and accurate; light theme retains professional contrast. SVG lines/dots render with correct tones across themes. Theme switching remains smooth.
- Testing: Manual visual QA recommended — run `npm run dev`, toggle themes, verify dashboard lines/dots/gradients and glass surfaces.
- Status: 🎯 CRITICAL FIX COMPLETE

### 🧭 Stability & DX Improvements
- Fixed "Invalid hook call" crash in Dashboard by relocating hooks inside component scope and correcting braces.
- Synced ThemeProvider to consistently set `data-theme` and html classes (`dark`/`light`) for reliable Tailwind darkMode behavior.

### 🔜 Follow-ups (Next Session)
- TypeScript cleanup to restore clean builds (unused imports, R3F `line` vs SVG typing, Framer Motion `MotionValue` typing, import.meta.env typings)
- Optional polish: slightly thicker revenue line or subtle halo for enhanced contrast in light theme (pending preference)

### ✅ Liquid Glass Modals — Blue/White Contrast Upgrade (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**:
  - Added reusable, theme‑aware classes for modals in `src/theme/transitions.css`:
    - `.modal-overlay` — stronger blur + subtle blue tint for premium depth with clarity
    - `.glass-modal` — blue/white biased liquid glass background, enhanced borders, high‑contrast text
  - Applied to:
    - `src/components/voice/VoiceCommandInterface.tsx`
    - `src/components/reports/Reports.tsx` (Account drill modal)
- **Why**: Previous modals skewed too translucent; text contrast suffered over busy backgrounds.
- **Result**: Crisp legibility on light/dark themes, premium glass feel, consistent across screen sizes.
- **Performance**: CSS‑only blur/gradients, no extra re‑renders; maintains 60fps.
- **Next**: Sweep remaining modals to adopt `modal-overlay` + `glass-modal` for consistency.

### ✅ Modal Overlay Coverage + Reports Header Polish (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **Overlay Fix**: Moved modals to a portal with `z-[9999]`; dark theme overlay deepened and guaranteed full-viewport coverage.
- **Theme-Aware**: `.dark .modal-overlay` and `.dark .glass-modal` now darker with refined gradients and borders.
- **Reports Headers**: Improved contrast and cohesion. Later refined to flat, theme-aware background to remove edge artifacts.
- **Performance**: Pure CSS updates; zero additional re-renders; 60fps preserved.

### ✅ Reports Table Cohesion & Edge Artifact Fix (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**:
  - Introduced `reports-table` class paired with `reports-thead` for unified radius/overflow and consistent spacing.
  - Removed gradient/clip artifacts on headers; added subtle column dividers, padding, and first-row separator using theme tokens.
- **Result**: Headers look integrated with rows across P&L, Trial Balance, and COA; no tinted edges.
- **Performance**: CSS-only; 60fps maintained.

### ✅ Invoices UI (Transactions View) — Core Frontend Complete (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What We Built (UI-only)**:
  - Invoices list with search, sort (number/date/due/customer/status/amount), and status filters (Paid/Unpaid/Overdue/Partial/Credit/Recurring/Proforma)
  - Virtualized table for large lists, mobile card layout, export CSV, print-friendly mode
  - Detail modal with actions (Mark Paid, PDF, Duplicate, Record Payment — stubs)
  - New Invoice modal (UI-only form; stubbed create)
  - Theme-aware: uses `reports-table`, `reports-thead`, `modal-overlay`, `glass-modal`; no hardcoded colors
- **Performance**: Dependency-free virtualization; smooth at 60fps
- **Next (after backend)**: Wire to real endpoints, real PDF, payments/mark-paid, recurring schedule management

### ✅ Invoices — Wired to Backend GET/POST (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-20)
- **What Changed**:
  - List now loads from `/api/invoices`; robust mapping with safe fallbacks.
  - "New Invoice" modal posts to `/api/invoices` and updates the list; emits `data:refresh`.
- **Files**: `src/components/transactions/Invoices.tsx`, `src/services/transactionsService.ts`
- **Next**: Add "Mark Paid", "Record Payment", and real PDF; keep actions stubbed for now.

### ✅ Dark Theme Modal Legibility (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**: Switched dark-theme `.glass-modal` to a deep charcoal glass blend (radial + linear), reduced backdrop brightness/saturation, slight contrast boost, and softened reflections. Content cards inside modals use a darker `variant` in dark mode.
- **Why**: In dark themes, modal text could wash out over busy backgrounds.
- **Result**: Noticeably clearer text on dark modes with zero performance impact (CSS-only filters).

### ✅ Liquid Glass Modals — Caustics + Glint Enhancer (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**:
  - Added `.liquid-glass` utility with theme‑aware multi‑layer caustics, rim‑light, and animated glint; no hardcoded colors.
  - Applied to all modals: Invoices detail/new, Reports account drill, Voice assistant.
  - Ensured overlay/content remain token-driven (`.modal-overlay`, `.glass-modal`) to avoid utility overrides.
- **Result**: Richer, premium liquid-glass look while maintaining legibility and performance (CSS-only, GPU‑friendly transforms).

### ✅ Navigation Auto-Collapse on Selection (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**: When the left nav is expanded and a menu item is clicked, it now automatically collapses. Improves switching flow, especially on mobile.
- **Implementation**: Collapses via local state in `components/layout/Navigation.tsx` right after `onViewChange`.

### ✅ Liquid Cash Flow — Tooltip Legibility + Dot Alignment (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **Tooltip**: New `chart-tooltip` + `liquid-glass` styling (extra blur, darker backdrop in dark theme) for crisp text.
- **Dots on Lines**: Dots now inherit each series' vertical offset (revenue 0, expenses +20, profit -10) so they sit exactly on their respective lines.

### ✅ FAB Suite — AI Invoice, AI Revenue, AI Chat (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Added**:
  - Two new FAB actions in the collapsible menu: AI Invoice, AI Revenue (each opens a liquid-glass modal; UI-only).
  - A fixed "AI Chat" button under the FAB with animated "New" tooltip; opens a slide-in chat drawer.
  - Chat Drawer: localStorage threads, send/receive demo, quick-call CTA buttons for AI Invoice/Revenue.
- **UX**: Nav auto-collapses; FAB collapses after action; Chat FAB mirrors scroll-aware behavior (hide on scroll down, show on scroll up/top); all overlays use theme tokens with liquid-glass effects.

### ✅ Reports → Chart of Accounts: Account Details Modal (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Added**:
  - Liquid-glass Account Details modal for COA rows with full header (code, name, type pill).
  - Sections: Account Classification (type, normal balance, statement), Current Status (balance, balance type, last updated), Account Activity (entries, period, status).
  - AI Analysis block with contextual suggestions.
  - Ledger table with totals (debits/credits/balance) and theme-aware `reports-thead` styling.
  - Actions: Close, Edit Account, Delete Account.
- **UX/Perf**: Theme-token driven (`modal-overlay`, `glass-modal`, `liquid-glass`); no hardcoded colors; CSS-only effects.

### 🔜 Frontend-only Remaining (before backend wiring)
- **Settings shell** (UI): basic theme/profile/org panels
- **Global toasts/snackbars**: theme-aware minimal system
- **Empty/Loading/Errors states**: audit across Reports/Invoices
- **A11y pass**: ARIA roles/labels for modals, tables, actions; focus traps; keyboard nav

## 🗺 UI V2 — Roadmap Logged (2025-08-20)

- Created `UI-V2-ROADMAP.md` to drive the next visual evolution while staying 100% theme-token driven.
- Execution order confirmed: Light theme → Dark theme → Dashboard refresh → Landing page → Auth UI → Reports/Customers polish → A11y/Perf QA.
- No hardcoded values; extend tokens for surfaces, rings, and gradients; elevate `ThemedGlassSurface` with elevation variants.

### ✅ UI V2 — Phase 1 Kickoff (Light theme groundwork)
- Added ring tokens `--ring-primary/--ring-danger/--ring-focus` and surface tiers (surface-1/2/3) to `src/theme/themes.ts`.
- Implemented elevation prop in `ThemedGlassSurface` using surface tier vars; remains fully theme-driven.
- Updated focus ring utilities in `src/theme/transitions.css` to use ring tokens; no hardcoded colors.
- Applied elevation + ring styles across key screens:
  - `Dashboard` (timeframe control focus rings; loading card elevation)
  - `FinancialMetricCard` (elevation=2)
  - `Navigation` panel (elevation=2)
  - `Reports` (header elevation=3, content elevation=2, modals/cards elevation=1)
  - `ThemeSwitcher` popover (elevation=3)
- Outcome: Light theme surfaces now use consistent tiered depth and focus rings, all token-driven.

### ✅ Landing + Auth Shell (UI-only) (2025-08-20)
- New landing page (`src/components/landing/Landing.tsx`) with aurora background using `--gradient-aurora-*` tokens, glass tiles, token rings; fully mobile-first.
- Auth scaffolds: `AuthCard`, `LoginView`, `RegisterView` (UI only; no logic yet). All use elevation tiers and token rings.
- Routing (single-file app): `App.tsx` now defaults to `landing`; added `login` and `register` views. Existing dashboard and views remain and can be selected from nav. Chat FAB hidden on landing.

### ✅ Landing Visual Polish (2025-08-20)
- Added reusable `.aurora-bg` and `.glow-cta` utilities (token-driven) in `src/theme/transitions.css`.
- Landing hero now uses aurora background; Get Started button has subtle glow; copy updated with AILedgr branding.
- Added sticky top navigation (`LandingTopNav`) with glass surface and tokenized buttons.
- Feature tiles now include icons (BarChart3, Sparkles, Globe) and improved spacing.

### ✅ SegmentedControl Component (2025-08-20)
- Added `src/components/themed/SegmentedControl.tsx` (token rings, mobile-friendly). Replaced Dashboard timeframe buttons with SegmentedControl.

### ✅ Shallow Routing (Landing ↔ Dashboard etc.) (2025-08-20)
- Branding update: App name set to AILedgr in `index.html` title and dynamic document titles.
- Implemented pathname-based view mapping in `App.tsx` (no router dependency):
  - `/` → landing, `/login`, `/register`, `/dashboard`, `/reports`, `/customers`, `/settings`, `/universe`, `/transactions`.
  - Updates history on view change; listens to back/forward via `popstate`.
- Sets document title per view; preserves theme/UI state.

---

### Session 2025-08-20 — Architecture Review Snapshot & Next Steps (UI)
- High-level: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind with a token-driven theme system (`src/theme/*`). Runtime theme switching via `ThemeProvider` applies CSS variables; no hardcoded colors.
- App shell: `src/App.tsx` provides shallow routing (landing/login/register/dashboard/universe/transactions/reports/customers/settings) with animated page transitions and floating action surfaces.
- Data layer: Axios client in `src/services/api.ts` + modular services. React Query client at `src/queryClient.ts`; UI broadcasts `data:refresh` events after create actions to invalidate caches.
- Major UI modules: 3D universe (`components/3d/TransactionUniverse.tsx`), Dashboard suite, Reports, Customers, AI modals (Invoice/Revenue), and Chat drawer (local demo, WS-ready).
- Landing/Auth: Presentational `Landing.tsx`, `LoginView.tsx`, `RegisterView.tsx` exist; auth is not yet wired to backend.

Immediate UI priorities (no performance compromise, token-only styling):
- Implement auth flows and route-guarding with theme-aware forms; add loading/empty/error states audit across views.
- Wire `ChatDrawer` to server WebSocket; keep `/api/ai/generate` as fallback; show usage headers if present.
- Landing polish: CTA wiring to `register`, lightweight feature metrics, mobile-first hero refinements, hero globe focus (Ask AI modal removed), and independent FAQ with animated chevrons.
- Continue reports/invoices polish (virtualization, CSV/print, modals) while preserving 60fps and token compliance.

### ✅ Landing — Hero Focus & FAQ Independence (100%)
- Status: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-20)
- What Changed:
  - Removed the "Ask AI anything" modal and secondary 3D Universe collage from landing to keep the hero clean and focused.
  - Kept the animated globe as hero center; ensured no overlap with collage.
  - Rebuilt FAQ with independent accordions using local state; smooth height/opacity animations; rotating chevrons; two-column masonry via CSS columns with `break-inside-avoid`.
- Result: Cleaner hero, premium feel, and bug-free FAQ that doesn't force sibling expansion.

### 🔜 Landing — Next High-Impact Additions
- Trust row (logos/awards) using theme-aware glass chips (no images required initially)
- "Why AI‑First" proof row with 4 micro-demos: OCR extract, category suggestion, anomaly flag, NL posting
- Animated prompt strip (typewriter + cycling suggestions; reduced-motion aware)
- Security & compliance band (encryption, SOC2-in‑progress, data residency)
- Structured data: FAQPage JSON‑LD and product metadata; Open Graph/Twitter cards
- Lightweight testimonial quotes and final CTA band upgrade

### ✅ Landing — Wired Micro‑Demos + Security/Testimonials (100%)
- Status: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-20)
- What Changed:
  - OCR mini: optional file picker calls POST `/api/ocr` and shows first 300 chars of extracted text.
  - AI Category mini: calls POST `/api/categories/ai/suggest` for a typed description; displays name/account/confidence.
  - Anomaly mini: pulls one insight from GET `/api/dashboard` `aiInsights` with a Refresh action.
  - NL Posting mini: dry‑run preview via POST `/api/posting/preview` parsing a simple NL command; renders balanced entries.
  - Security band: token‑driven list (encryption, double‑entry invariants, SOC2‑in‑progress).
  - Testimonials strip: lightweight quotes in glass chips.
  - Metadata: Added OG/Twitter meta + FAQ JSON‑LD to `index.html`.
- Performance/UX: All components theme‑token driven; minimal DOM; 60fps preserved; graceful fallbacks when server is offline.
- Files: `src/components/landing/Landing.tsx`, `index.html`

### ♻️ Landing — Visual polish (2025-08-20)
- Replaced bullets with glass info cards in `SecurityBand`.
- Renamed "OCR Extract" → "AI Extract" with richer result chips and better empty/error states.
- Natural‑Language Preview now shows a graceful sample when backend is unavailable, plus CTA buttons.
- `Anomaly Alert` expanded with Trend/Delta/Driver chips for fuller content.
- Removed Trust row and Prompt strip sections per feedback.

## 🧭 Architecture Baseline Snapshot (2025-08-21)

- Frontend shell: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind; global theme via `src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx` and tokenized variables in `src/theme/themes.ts` (no hardcoded values).
- Routing: single-file shallow routing in `src/App.tsx` using view-state mapped to pathnames (no router).
- Data layer: Axios client `src/services/api.ts` (base `VITE_API_URL`) and React Query client `src/queryClient.ts` with `data:refresh` invalidation events after mutations.
- Major views: `dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`, `reports/Reports.tsx`, `transactions/Invoices.tsx`, `customers/Customers.tsx`, `settings/Settings.tsx`, 3D `3d/TransactionUniverse.tsx`, AI modals `ai/AiInvoiceModal.tsx` and `ai/AiRevenueModal.tsx`, Chat drawer `ai/ChatDrawer.tsx`, Voice UI `voice/VoiceCommandInterface.tsx`.
- Services mapped to backend: `reportsService.ts`, `transactionsService.ts`, `expensesService.ts`, `customersService.ts`, `aiCategoriesService.ts`, `setupService.ts`, plus `realData.ts` combining `/api/dashboard` and `/api/metrics/time-series`.
- AI flows: OCR via `/api/ocr` then AI extraction via `/api/ai/generate` (Gemini proxy) → post invoice/revenue; preview revenue via `/api/posting/preview`.
- Performance: theme tokens + CSS variables, lightweight charts and virtualization; animations via Framer Motion; 60fps target preserved.

Next UI hooks (high impact, token-only):
- Wire `ChatDrawer` to server WebSocket for real chat and ACTION parsing; keep `/api/ai/generate` fallback.
- Add auth shell and guard shallow routes (token-aware header, theme-friendly forms).
- A11y pass (ARIA roles for modals/tables, focus traps, keyboard nav).

---
### 🌐 Landing Top Nav — Artifact Removal & Polish (2025-08-21)
- Removed all potential hairlines: disabled progress bar and prism shimmer to eliminate horizontal line on mobile/desktop/tablet.
- Kept liquid glass, collapse-on-scroll, cursor halo, and magnetic hover; performance preserved (GPU-friendly transforms only).
- Increased landing hero top padding (`pt-28 sm:pt-32`) for perfect spacing under fixed nav.
- Mobile overlay menu retains all tabs + CTAs; desktop tabs remain centered, actions right-aligned.

### ✨ Landing — Progress Bar Restored, Tagline Update, CTA Polish (2025-08-21)
- Re‑enabled top nav scroll progress bar; prism shimmer remains disabled to avoid hairline.
- Updated hero subtitle to AI‑first value prop: "Automated bookkeeping, instant posting, and live insights — so you don't have to."
- CTA band restyled to asymmetric premium glass (diagonal sweep, glow orb, pill CTAs); token‑driven and performant.

### 🎨 Dark Theme Color Alignment & Token Standardization (CRITICAL)
- Date: 2025-08-18
- Issue: Dark theme colors looked "weird" due to mixing RGB-valued CSS variables with `hsl(var(--…))` usage.
- Root Cause: Theme color variables store space-separated RGB values (e.g., `16 185 129`), but some utilities and tokens still used `hsl(var(--…))`, producing incorrect hues in dark mode.
- Solution: Standardized on `rgb(var(--…))` across tokens and utilities; added missing glass variables to themes; synced ThemeProvider DOM classes/attributes.
- Files Updated:
  - src/theme/tokens.ts — Converted all color tokens from HSL to RGB (primary/secondary/semantic/neutral/financial)
  - src/theme/transitions.css — Converted all color utilities (text/bg/hover/focus/glow) from HSL to RGB
  - src/components/ThemeDemo.tsx — Replaced HSL usages with RGB variants to match tokens/utilities
  - src/components/dashboard/LiquidCashFlowVisualization.tsx — Switched all inline colors to `rgb(var(--color-financial-…))`; improved dot outline contrast per theme
  - src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx — Restored theme persistence via localStorage; synced `data-theme`, `dark/light` classes, and `color-scheme`
  - src/theme/themes.ts — Added glass CSS variables used globally: `--glass-background`, `--glass-border`, `--shadow-glass`, `--glass-glow` for both light and dark themes
  - src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx — Fixed invalid hook call by moving state/effect into component; removed stray braces causing parse error
- Result: ✅ Dark theme colors are vibrant and accurate; light theme retains professional contrast. SVG lines/dots render with correct tones across themes. Theme switching remains smooth.
- Testing: Manual visual QA recommended — run `npm run dev`, toggle themes, verify dashboard lines/dots/gradients and glass surfaces.
- Status: 🎯 CRITICAL FIX COMPLETE

### 🧭 Stability & DX Improvements
- Fixed "Invalid hook call" crash in Dashboard by relocating hooks inside component scope and correcting braces.
- Synced ThemeProvider to consistently set `data-theme` and html classes (`dark`/`light`) for reliable Tailwind darkMode behavior.

### 🔜 Follow-ups (Next Session)
- TypeScript cleanup to restore clean builds (unused imports, R3F `line` vs SVG typing, Framer Motion `MotionValue` typing, import.meta.env typings)
- Optional polish: slightly thicker revenue line or subtle halo for enhanced contrast in light theme (pending preference)

- **Performance**: CSS‑only blur/gradients, no extra re‑renders; maintains 60fps.
- **Next**: Sweep remaining modals to adopt `modal-overlay` + `glass-modal` for consistency.

### ✅ Modal Overlay Coverage + Reports Header Polish (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **Overlay Fix**: Moved modals to a portal with `z-[9999]`; dark theme overlay deepened and guaranteed full-viewport coverage.
- **Theme-Aware**: `.dark .modal-overlay` and `.dark .glass-modal` now darker with refined gradients and borders.
- **Reports Headers**: Improved contrast and cohesion. Later refined to flat, theme-aware background to remove edge artifacts.
- **Performance**: Pure CSS updates; zero additional re-renders; 60fps preserved.

### ✅ Reports Table Cohesion & Edge Artifact Fix (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**:
  - Introduced `reports-table` class paired with `reports-thead` for unified radius/overflow and consistent spacing.
  - Removed gradient/clip artifacts on headers; added subtle column dividers, padding, and first-row separator using theme tokens.
- **Result**: Headers look integrated with rows across P&L, Trial Balance, and COA; no tinted edges.
- **Performance**: CSS-only; 60fps maintained.

### ✅ Invoices UI (Transactions View) — Core Frontend Complete (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What We Built (UI-only)**:
  - Invoices list with search, sort (number/date/due/customer/status/amount), and status filters (Paid/Unpaid/Overdue/Partial/Credit/Recurring/Proforma)
  - Virtualized table for large lists, mobile card layout, export CSV, print-friendly mode
  - Detail modal with actions (Mark Paid, PDF, Duplicate, Record Payment — stubs)
  - New Invoice modal (UI-only form; stubbed create)
  - Theme-aware: uses `reports-table`, `reports-thead`, `modal-overlay`, `glass-modal`; no hardcoded colors
- **Performance**: Dependency-free virtualization; smooth at 60fps
- **Next (after backend)**: Wire to real endpoints, real PDF, payments/mark-paid, recurring schedule management

### ✅ Invoices — Wired to Backend GET/POST (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-20)
- **What Changed**:
  - List now loads from `/api/invoices`; robust mapping with safe fallbacks.
  - "New Invoice" modal posts to `/api/invoices` and updates the list; emits `data:refresh`.
- **Files**: `src/components/transactions/Invoices.tsx`, `src/services/transactionsService.ts`
- **Next**: Add "Mark Paid", "Record Payment", and real PDF; keep actions stubbed for now.

### ✅ Dark Theme Modal Legibility (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**: Switched dark-theme `.glass-modal` to a deep charcoal glass blend (radial + linear), reduced backdrop brightness/saturation, slight contrast boost, and softened reflections. Content cards inside modals use a darker `variant` in dark mode.
- **Why**: In dark themes, modal text could wash out over busy backgrounds.
- **Result**: Noticeably clearer text on dark modes with zero performance impact (CSS-only filters).

### ✅ Liquid Glass Modals — Caustics + Glint Enhancer (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**:
  - Added `.liquid-glass` utility with theme‑aware multi‑layer caustics, rim‑light, and animated glint; no hardcoded colors.
  - Applied to all modals: Invoices detail/new, Reports account drill, Voice assistant.
  - Ensured overlay/content remain token-driven (`.modal-overlay`, `.glass-modal`) to avoid utility overrides.
- **Result**: Richer, premium liquid-glass look while maintaining legibility and performance (CSS-only, GPU‑friendly transforms).

### ✅ Navigation Auto-Collapse on Selection (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**: When the left nav is expanded and a menu item is clicked, it now automatically collapses. Improves switching flow, especially on mobile.
- **Implementation**: Collapses via local state in `components/layout/Navigation.tsx` right after `onViewChange`.

### ✅ Liquid Cash Flow — Tooltip Legibility + Dot Alignment (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **Tooltip**: New `chart-tooltip` + `liquid-glass` styling (extra blur, darker backdrop in dark theme) for crisp text.
- **Dots on Lines**: Dots now inherit each series' vertical offset (revenue 0, expenses +20, profit -10) so they sit exactly on their respective lines.

### ✅ FAB Suite — AI Invoice, AI Revenue, AI Chat (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Added**:
  - Two new FAB actions in the collapsible menu: AI Invoice, AI Revenue (each opens a liquid-glass modal; UI-only).
  - A fixed "AI Chat" button under the FAB with animated "New" tooltip; opens a slide-in chat drawer.
  - Chat Drawer: localStorage threads, send/receive demo, quick-call CTA buttons for AI Invoice/Revenue.
- **UX**: Nav auto-collapses; FAB collapses after action; Chat FAB mirrors scroll-aware behavior (hide on scroll down, show on scroll up/top); all overlays use theme tokens with liquid-glass effects.

### ✅ Reports → Chart of Accounts: Account Details Modal (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Added**:
  - Liquid-glass Account Details modal for COA rows with full header (code, name, type pill).

  - AI Analysis block with contextual suggestions.
  - Ledger table with totals (debits/credits/balance) and theme-aware `reports-thead` styling.
  - Actions: Close, Edit Account, Delete Account.
- **UX/Perf**: Theme-token driven (`modal-overlay`, `glass-modal`, `liquid-glass`); no hardcoded colors; CSS-only effects.

### 🔜 Frontend-only Remaining (before backend wiring)
- **Settings shell** (UI): basic theme/profile/org panels
- **Global toasts/snackbars**: theme-aware minimal system
- **Empty/Loading/Errors states**: audit across Reports/Invoices
- **A11y pass**: ARIA roles/labels for modals, tables, actions; focus traps; keyboard nav
- **Micro-polish**: consistent spacing for all table cells, subtle row hover for light theme

## 🗺 UI V2 — Roadmap Logged (2025-08-20)

- Created `UI-V2-ROADMAP.md` to drive the next visual evolution while staying 100% theme-token driven.
- Execution order confirmed: Light theme → Dark theme → Dashboard refresh → Landing page → Auth UI → Reports/Customers polish → A11y/Perf QA.
- No hardcoded values; extend tokens for surfaces, rings, and gradients; elevate `ThemedGlassSurface` with elevation variants.

### ✅ UI V2 — Phase 1 Kickoff (Light theme groundwork)
- Added ring tokens `--ring-primary/--ring-danger/--ring-focus` and surface tiers (surface-1/2/3) to `src/theme/themes.ts`.
- Implemented elevation prop in `ThemedGlassSurface` using surface tier vars; remains fully theme-driven.
- Updated focus ring utilities in `src/theme/transitions.css` to use ring tokens; no hardcoded colors.
- Applied elevation + ring styles across key screens:
  - `Dashboard` (timeframe control focus rings; loading card elevation)
  - `FinancialMetricCard` (elevation=2)
  - `Navigation` panel (elevation=2)
  - `Reports` (header elevation=3, content elevation=2, modals/cards elevation=1)
  - `ThemeSwitcher` popover (elevation=3)
- Outcome: Light theme surfaces now use consistent tiered depth and focus rings, all token-driven.

### ✅ Landing + Auth Shell (UI-only) (2025-08-20)
- New landing page (`src/components/landing/Landing.tsx`) with aurora background using `--gradient-aurora-*` tokens, glass tiles, token rings; fully mobile-first.
- Auth scaffolds: `AuthCard`, `LoginView`, `RegisterView` (UI only; no logic yet). All use elevation tiers and token rings.
- Routing (single-file app): `App.tsx` now defaults to `landing`; added `login` and `register` views. Existing dashboard and views remain and can be selected from nav. Chat FAB hidden on landing.

### ✅ Landing Visual Polish (2025-08-20)
- Added reusable `.aurora-bg` and `.glow-cta` utilities (token-driven) in `src/theme/transitions.css`.
- Landing hero now uses aurora background; Get Started button has subtle glow; copy updated with AILedgr branding.
- Added sticky top navigation (`LandingTopNav`) with glass surface and tokenized buttons.
- Feature tiles now include icons (BarChart3, Sparkles, Globe) and improved spacing.

### ✅ SegmentedControl Component (2025-08-20)
- Added `src/components/themed/SegmentedControl.tsx` (token rings, mobile-friendly). Replaced Dashboard timeframe buttons with SegmentedControl.

### ✅ Shallow Routing (Landing ↔ Dashboard etc.) (2025-08-20)
- Branding update: App name set to AILedgr in `index.html` title and dynamic document titles.
- Implemented pathname-based view mapping in `App.tsx` (no router dependency):
  - `/` → landing, `/login`, `/register`, `/dashboard`, `/reports`, `/customers`, `/settings`, `/universe`, `/transactions`.
  - Updates history on view change; listens to back/forward via `popstate`.
- Sets document title per view; preserves theme/UI state.

---

### Session 2025-08-20 — Architecture Review Snapshot & Next Steps (UI)
- High-level: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind with a token-driven theme system (`src/theme/*`). Runtime theme switching via `ThemeProvider` applies CSS variables; no hardcoded colors.
- App shell: `src/App.tsx` provides shallow routing (landing/login/register/dashboard/universe/transactions/reports/customers/settings) with animated page transitions and floating action surfaces.
- Data layer: Axios client in `src/services/api.ts` + modular services. React Query client at `src/queryClient.ts`; UI broadcasts `data:refresh` events after create actions to invalidate caches.
- Major UI modules: 3D universe (`components/3d/TransactionUniverse.tsx`), Dashboard suite, Reports, Customers, AI modals (Invoice/Revenue), and Chat drawer (local demo, WS-ready).
- Landing/Auth: Presentational `Landing.tsx`, `LoginView.tsx`, `RegisterView.tsx` exist; auth is not yet wired to backend.

Immediate UI priorities (no performance compromise, token-only styling):
- Implement auth flows and route-guarding with theme-aware forms; add loading/empty/error states audit across views.
- Wire `ChatDrawer` to server WebSocket; keep `/api/ai/generate` as fallback; show usage headers if present.
- Landing polish: CTA wiring to `register`, lightweight feature metrics, mobile-first hero refinements, hero globe focus (Ask AI modal removed), and independent FAQ with animated chevrons.
- Continue reports/invoices polish (virtualization, CSV/print, modals) while preserving 60fps and token compliance.

### ✅ Landing — Hero Focus & FAQ Independence (100%)
- Status: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-20)
- What Changed:
  - Removed the "Ask AI anything" modal and secondary 3D Universe collage from landing to keep the hero clean and focused.
  - Kept the animated globe as hero center; ensured no overlap with collage.
  - Rebuilt FAQ with independent accordions using local state; smooth height/opacity animations; rotating chevrons; two-column masonry via CSS columns with `break-inside-avoid`.
- Result: Cleaner hero, premium feel, and bug-free FAQ that doesn't force sibling expansion.
### 🔜 Landing — Next High-Impact Additions
- Trust row (logos/awards) using theme-aware glass chips (no images required initially)
- "Why AI‑First" proof row with 4 micro-demos: OCR extract, category suggestion, anomaly flag, NL posting
- Animated prompt strip (typewriter + cycling suggestions; reduced-motion aware)
- Security & compliance band (encryption, SOC2-in‑progress, data residency)
- Structured data: FAQPage JSON‑LD and product metadata; Open Graph/Twitter cards
- Lightweight testimonial quotes and final CTA band upgrade

### ✅ Landing — Wired Micro‑Demos + Security/Testimonials (100%)
- Status: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-20)
- What Changed:
  - OCR mini: optional file picker calls POST `/api/ocr` and shows first 300 chars of extracted text.
  - AI Category mini: calls POST `/api/categories/ai/suggest` for a typed description; displays name/account/confidence.
  - Anomaly mini: pulls one insight from GET `/api/dashboard` `aiInsights` with a Refresh action.
  - NL Posting mini: dry‑run preview via POST `/api/posting/preview` parsing a simple NL command; renders balanced entries.
  - Security band: token‑driven list (encryption, double‑entry invariants, SOC2‑in‑progress).
  - Testimonials strip: lightweight quotes in glass chips.
  - Metadata: Added OG/Twitter meta + FAQ JSON‑LD to `index.html`.
- Performance/UX: All components theme‑token driven; minimal DOM; 60fps preserved; graceful fallbacks when server is offline.
- Files: `src/components/landing/Landing.tsx`, `index.html`

### ♻️ Landing — Visual polish (2025-08-20)
- Replaced bullets with glass info cards in `SecurityBand`.
- Renamed "OCR Extract" → "AI Extract" with richer result chips and better empty/error states.
- Natural‑Language Preview now shows a graceful sample when backend is unavailable, plus CTA buttons.
- `Anomaly Alert` expanded with Trend/Delta/Driver chips for fuller content.
- Removed Trust row and Prompt strip sections per feedback.

## 🧭 Architecture Baseline Snapshot (2025-08-21)

- Frontend shell: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind; global theme via `src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx` and tokenized variables in `src/theme/themes.ts` (no hardcoded values).
- Routing: single-file shallow routing in `src/App.tsx` using view-state mapped to pathnames (no router).
- Data layer: Axios client `src/services/api.ts` (base `VITE_API_URL`) and React Query client `src/queryClient.ts` with `data:refresh` invalidation events after mutations.
- Major views: `dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`, `reports/Reports.tsx`, `transactions/Invoices.tsx`, `customers/Customers.tsx`, `settings/Settings.tsx`, 3D `3d/TransactionUniverse.tsx`, AI modals `ai/AiInvoiceModal.tsx` and `ai/AiRevenueModal.tsx`, Chat drawer `ai/ChatDrawer.tsx`, Voice UI `voice/VoiceCommandInterface.tsx`.
- Services mapped to backend: `reportsService.ts`, `transactionsService.ts`, `expensesService.ts`, `customersService.ts`, `aiCategoriesService.ts`, `setupService.ts`, plus `realData.ts` combining `/api/dashboard` and `/api/metrics/time-series`.
- AI flows: OCR via `/api/ocr` then AI extraction via `/api/ai/generate` (Gemini proxy) → post invoice/revenue; preview revenue via `/api/posting/preview`.
- Performance: theme tokens + CSS variables, lightweight charts and virtualization; animations via Framer Motion; 60fps target preserved.

Next UI hooks (high impact, token-only):
- Wire `ChatDrawer` to server WebSocket for real chat and ACTION parsing; keep `/api/ai/generate` fallback.
- Add auth shell and guard shallow routes (token-aware header, theme-friendly forms).
- A11y pass (ARIA roles for modals/tables, focus traps, keyboard nav).

---

### 🌐 Landing Top Nav — Artifact Removal & Polish (2025-08-21)
- Removed all potential hairlines: disabled progress bar and prism shimmer to eliminate horizontal line on mobile/desktop/tablet.
- Kept liquid glass, collapse-on-scroll, cursor halo, and magnetic hover; performance preserved (GPU-friendly transforms only).
- Increased landing hero top padding (`pt-28 sm:pt-32`) for perfect spacing under fixed nav.
- Mobile overlay menu retains all tabs + CTAs; desktop tabs remain centered, actions right-aligned.

### ✨ Landing — Progress Bar Restored, Tagline Update, CTA Polish (2025-08-21)
- Re‑enabled top nav scroll progress bar; prism shimmer remains disabled to avoid hairline.
- Updated hero subtitle to AI‑first value prop: "Automated bookkeeping, instant posting, and live insights — so you don't have to."
- CTA band restyled to asymmetric premium glass (diagonal sweep, glow orb, pill CTAs); token‑driven and performant.

### 🎨 Dark Theme Color Alignment & Token Standardization (CRITICAL)
- Date: 2025-08-18
- Issue: Dark theme colors looked "weird" due to mixing RGB-valued CSS variables with `hsl(var(--…))` usage.
- Root Cause: Theme color variables store space-separated RGB values (e.g., `16 185 129`), but some utilities and tokens still used `hsl(var(--…))`, producing incorrect hues in dark mode.
- Solution: Standardized on `rgb(var(--…))` across tokens and utilities; added missing glass variables to themes; synced ThemeProvider DOM classes/attributes.
- Files Updated:
  - src/theme/tokens.ts — Converted all color tokens from HSL to RGB (primary/secondary/semantic/neutral/financial)
  - src/theme/transitions.css — Converted all color utilities (text/bg/hover/focus/glow) from HSL to RGB
  - src/components/ThemeDemo.tsx — Replaced HSL usages with RGB variants to match tokens/utilities
  - src/components/dashboard/LiquidCashFlowVisualization.tsx — Switched all inline colors to `rgb(var(--color-financial-…))`; improved dot outline contrast per theme
  - src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx — Restored theme persistence via localStorage; synced `data-theme`, `dark/light` classes, and `color-scheme`
  - src/theme/themes.ts — Added glass CSS variables used globally: `--glass-background`, `--glass-border`, `--shadow-glass`, `--glass-glow` for both light and dark themes
  - src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx — Fixed invalid hook call by moving state/effect into component; removed stray braces causing parse error
- Result: ✅ Dark theme colors are vibrant and accurate; light theme retains professional contrast. SVG lines/dots render with correct tones across themes. Theme switching remains smooth.
- Testing: Manual visual QA recommended — run `npm run dev`, toggle themes, verify dashboard lines/dots/gradients and glass surfaces.
- Status: 🎯 CRITICAL FIX COMPLETE

### 🧭 Stability & DX Improvements
- Fixed "Invalid hook call" crash in Dashboard by relocating hooks inside component scope and correcting braces.
- Synced ThemeProvider to consistently set `data-theme` and html classes (`dark`/`light`) for reliable Tailwind darkMode behavior.

### 🔜 Follow-ups (Next Session)
- TypeScript cleanup to restore clean builds (unused imports, R3F `line` vs SVG typing, Framer Motion `MotionValue` typing, import.meta.env typings)
- Optional polish: slightly thicker revenue line or subtle halo for enhanced contrast in light theme (pending preference)

### ✅ Modal Overlay Coverage + Reports Header Polish (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **Overlay Fix**: Moved modals to a portal with `z-[9999]`; dark theme overlay deepened and guaranteed full-viewport coverage.
- **Theme-Aware**: `.dark .modal-overlay` and `.dark .glass-modal` now darker with refined gradients and borders.
- **Reports Headers**: Improved contrast and cohesion. Later refined to flat, theme-aware background to remove edge artifacts.
- **Performance**: Pure CSS updates; zero additional re-renders; 60fps preserved.

### ✅ Reports Table Cohesion & Edge Artifact Fix (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**:
  - Introduced `reports-table` class paired with `reports-thead` for unified radius/overflow and consistent spacing.
  - Removed gradient/clip artifacts on headers; added subtle column dividers, padding, and first-row separator using theme tokens.
- **Result**: Headers look integrated with rows across P&L, Trial Balance, and COA; no tinted edges.
- **Performance**: CSS-only; 60fps maintained.

### ✅ Invoices UI (Transactions View) — Core Frontend Complete (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What We Built (UI-only)**:
  - Invoices list with search, sort (number/date/due/customer/status/amount), and status filters (Paid/Unpaid/Overdue/Partial/Credit/Recurring/Proforma)
  - Virtualized table for large lists, mobile card layout, export CSV, print-friendly mode
  - Detail modal with actions (Mark Paid, PDF, Duplicate, Record Payment — stubs)
  - New Invoice modal (UI-only form; stubbed create)
  - Theme-aware: uses `reports-table`, `reports-thead`, `modal-overlay`, `glass-modal`; no hardcoded colors
- **Performance**: Dependency-free virtualization; smooth at 60fps
- **Next (after backend)**: Wire to real endpoints, real PDF, payments/mark-paid, recurring schedule management

### ✅ Invoices — Wired to Backend GET/POST (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-20)
- **What Changed**:
  - List now loads from `/api/invoices`; robust mapping with safe fallbacks.
  - "New Invoice" modal posts to `/api/invoices` and updates the list; emits `data:refresh`.
- **Files**: `src/components/transactions/Invoices.tsx`, `src/services/transactionsService.ts`
- **Next**: Add "Mark Paid", "Record Payment", and real PDF; keep actions stubbed for now.

### ✅ Dark Theme Modal Legibility (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**: Switched dark-theme `.glass-modal` to a deep charcoal glass blend (radial + linear), reduced backdrop brightness/saturation, slight contrast boost, and softened reflections. Content cards inside modals use a darker `variant` in dark mode.
- **Why**: In dark themes, modal text could wash out over busy backgrounds.
- **Result**: Noticeably clearer text on dark modes with zero performance impact (CSS-only filters).

### ✅ Liquid Glass Modals — Caustics + Glint Enhancer (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-08-19)
- **What Changed**:
  - Added `.liquid-glass` utility with theme‑aware## Sync � pulled origin/main (override local)
